# Smart-Facility-Management-System-ServiceNow-

Problem Statement:

Organizations face delays and inefficiencies because facility issues (AC, lights, projectors, escalators) are reported manually. This leads to no tracking, missed deadlines, and poor user satisfaction.

 Solution:

Designed a Service Catalog item: “Report a Facility Issue” form.

Automated workflow routing to the Facilities Team using Flow Designer.

Applied SLA definitions for urgent vs. normal issues.

Configured notifications to update employees about ticket status.

Built dashboards for facility managers to track requests and SLA breaches.

Added a Knowledge Base (KB) for minor fixes (e.g., resetting projectors, AC troubleshooting).

 Impact:

Faster issue resolution and reduced downtime.

Improved transparency with live updates and dashboards.

Boosted employee satisfaction by empowering self-service through KB.
